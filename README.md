# Novel Data Mining Algorithm for Classification

### Objective 
Develope and investigate a new data mining algorithm to solve classifictaion problems. The new classification algorithm is developed to improve: (1) the recall score of the well-known classification algorithms such as K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes (NB), and Logistic Regression (LR) for recall-oriented Machine Learning (ML) tasks such as disease diagnosis, and (2) improve the speed of the existing MAX FS classification methods while improving or preserving the accuracy.

### Achivements
According to the experimental results, the introduced classification algorithm

- Provides better total accuracy compared to KNN, SVM, NB, and LR methods with and without hyperparameter tuning. and lterature MAX FS classification methods.
- Improves the speed of thelterature MAX FS classification methods by about 94% while improving the accuracy.
- Provides promising results for recall-oriented machine learning tasks such as disease diagnosis.
